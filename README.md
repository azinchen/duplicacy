`azinchen/duplicacy` is a Docker image created to easily perform automated backups. It uses [Duplicacy][duplicacy-home] under the hood, and therefore supports:

- Multiple storage backends: S3, Backblaze B2, Hubic, Dropbox, SFTP...
- Client-side encryption
- Deduplication
- Multi-versioning
- ... and more generally, all the features that duplicacy has.

`azinchen/duplicacy` uses [Duplicacy Command Line version][duplicacy-github] `3.0.1`.

## Supported Architectures

The image supports multiple architectures such as `amd64`, `x86`, `arm/v6`, `arm/v7` and `arm64`.

You can run the following command to launch a standalone instance of Duplicacy on Docker:

```bash
docker run \
  -v path_to_data:/data \
  -e BACKUP_CRON="0 1 * * *" \
  -e SNAPSHOT_ID="id" \

  azinchen/duplicacy
